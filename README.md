This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, model building, and deployment. The projects cover a range of topics and techniques, from supervised and unsupervised learning to deep learning and model optimization. Each project includes well-documented code, explanations, and results. 

Key areas include:
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets to extract meaningful insights.
* Model Development: Implementing and tuning machine learning models such as regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.
* Deep Learning: Building and training neural networks with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
* Evaluation and Optimization: Using various metrics to evaluate model performance and applying optimization techniques to improve accuracy.
* Deployment: Integrating models into real-world applications and deploying them using frameworks like Flask and Docker.
* Explore the repository to see my approach to solving different machine learning challenges!
