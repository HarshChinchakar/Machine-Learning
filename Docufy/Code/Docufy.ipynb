Moseley showed that the frequency  of x-ray emitted by an element is  related to atomic number, Z, rather than the atomic mass.   The atomic number, Z, was considered as more  fundamental property of the atom than the atomic mass. As a result, Mendeleev’s periodic  law was modified.\n",

The tendency to lose valence electron is the metallic character, which increases down the group.

More the charge on cation, stronger is  the ion-dipole interaction. For example, Mg2⊕  ion has higher charge and smaller ionic radius (78 pm) than Na ⊕ ion (98 pm), hence Mg2⊕ ion  is surrounded (hydrated) more strongly with water molecules and exerts strong ion-dipole interaction.

In general, all atoms and molecules experience London dispersion forces, which result from the motion of electrons. At any given instant of time, the electron distribution in an atom may be asymmetrical, giving the atom a short lived dipole moment. This momentary dipole on one atom can affect the electron distribution in the neighbouring atoms and induce momentary dipoles in them. As a result, weak attractive force develops.\n",

            "If the  coulomb repulsion had been the only force in operation the nucleus would not exist. However the nucleus does exist. This indicates that there are nuclear forces of attraction between all the nucleons holding them together within the nucleus. These are attractions between proton-proton, neutron-neutron and proton-neutron. These attractive forces are independent of the charge on nucleons. Hence p-p, n-n and p-n attractions are equal. These attractive forces operate over short range within the nucleus.    The p-p, n-n and p-n attractions  constitute what is called the nuclear potential which is responsible for the nuclear stability.\n",

Balanced chemical equation is symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. It supplies the  following information which is useful in solving problems based on chemical equations  i. It indicat es the number of moles of the reactants involved in a chemical reaction and the  number of moles of the products formed. Step III :  Convert into number/of moles of  each element. Divide the masses obtained above by respective atomic masses of various elements.\n",

Chemical Equilibrium 12.1 Introduction : You have learnt earlier  that changes can be physical or chemical and reversible or irreversible. All the changes listed above are irreversible physical changes.

We noted earlier that an equilibrium state is attained when the rate of the forward and reverse reactions become equal (refer Fig. Fig. 12.4 (a) : Graph of forward and reverse  reaction rates versus time for conversion of N 2O4 to NO2Time  Time Concentration RateEquilibium  achieved Equilibium achieved (rates are equal)NO2 N2O4 kf[N2O4] kf[NO2]20  0  Fig. 12.4 (b) : Changes in reaction rates during  a reversible reaction attaining a chemical equilibrium.\n",

            "[19 ].   Early screening for diabetic retinopathy is important as early treatment can  prevent vision loss and blindness in the rapidly growing population of patients with diabetes.   Such screening also provides the opportunity to identify other eye diseases, as well as providing indicators of cardiovascular disease.      T he increasing need for such screening, and the demands for expert ana lysis that it creates,  motivates the goal of low cost, quantitative retinal image analysis.   Routine imaging for screening uses the specially designed optics of a ‘fundus camera,’ with several images taken at differen t orientations (fields, see Figure  2) 2010:   Retinal Imaging and Image Analysis, Michael D. Abràmoff,  Mona K. Garvin,  Milan Sonka,  IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2010 January 1; 3: 169–208. doi:10.1109/RBME.2010.2084567.    20.

[21] for diabetic retinopathy in the UK  require at least 80% sensitivity and 95% specificity to determine referral for further evaluation.   Screening using fundus photography, followed by manual image analysis, yields sensitivity and specificity rates cited as 96%/89% when two fields (angles of view) are included, and 92%/97% for three fields.   (For a single field, cited rates are 78%/86%).      R ecently a transformational advance in automated retinal image analysis, using Deep Learning   algorithms, has been demonstrated [2 2].   The algorithm was trained against a data set of over  100,000 images [2 3], which were recorded with one field (macula- centered). 2016:   Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of Diabetic  Retinopathy in Retinal Fundus Photographs, Varun Gulshan, Lily Peng, Marc Coram, Martin C.

In addition, however, each also required the development of a labeled training set.   In the retinopathy example these were obtained via labor - intensive independent professional assessments of the images.    In the dermatology case, the  training was also based on clinician assessm ents of the images. Classification results for a set of 130 images of melanocytic lesions, blue curve from the algorithm, red dots from individual dermatologists.   Images taken from Esteva et al. 2017 [3 0].     b 14      A  further classification test was performed drawing only on images that were biopsy-proven to  be in a specific disease class.   The algorithm then was run to answer only the question of whether  the lesion in the image was benign or malignant.   The results for analysis of 130 images of melanocytic lesions are shown in Fig ure 3b, compared with results from assessments by 22  different dermatologists. 2.1 Advances in AI Applications for Medical Imaging     I n the following sections, we review examples in which applications of Deep Learning have been  demonstrated, with attention to quantitative understanding of characteristics of the data sets, the problem definition, and the nature of the comparison standard used for labeling the sets.    The two e xamples described are based on m edical imaging, specifically diabetic retinopathy and  dermatology.       2.1.1 D etection of d iabetic r etinopathy in r etinal f undus images    M any diseases of the eye can be diagnosed through non-invasive imaging of the retina through  the pupil\n",
