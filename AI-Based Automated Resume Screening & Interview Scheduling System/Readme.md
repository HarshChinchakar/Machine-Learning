4. AI-Based Automated Resume Screening & Interview Scheduling System
Problem Statement:
HR teams receive thousands of resumes, making manual screening inefficient. Thereâ€™s a need for an AI-driven system to screen resumes, match candidates to job descriptions, and schedule interviews.

Solution:
Develop an AI-powered HR system that:
Parses resumes & extracts skills, experience, education
Matches resumes to job descriptions using NLP
Ranks candidates based on relevance
Auto-schedules interviews based on availability

DBMS Dependence:

Relational DB (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for storing candidate details.
Vector DB (FAISS/Pinecone) for similarity search between resumes & job descriptions.
Document DB (Elasticsearch) for fast resume retrieval.
Triggers & Stored Procedures for auto-updating interview schedules.

ML Component:
Transformers (BERT/DistilBERT) for skill extraction.
Cosine Similarity + TF-IDF for matching resumes to job descriptions.
Reinforcement Learning for optimizing interview scheduling.

Use Case:
Reduces HR workload by automating candidate screening & scheduling interviews.
